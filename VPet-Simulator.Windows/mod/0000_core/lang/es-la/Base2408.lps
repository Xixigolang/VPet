祝我生日快乐~♪祝我生日快乐~♪，主人猜猜今天是什么日子？我的生日！主人真聪明！我就知道主人一定会记得我的生日的！谢谢主人！快来和我一起过生日吧~主人给我买的蛋糕真香啊~首先是是吹蜡烛许愿，我看看我的愿望清单: 一台5090电脑，嗨神话:吗喽 数字豪华版，还有...#Happy birthday to me~♪ Happy birthday to me~♪, Master, guess what day it is today? My birthday! Master is so smart! I knew Master would remember my birthday! Thank you, Master! Come and celebrate my birthday with me~ The cake Master bought for me smells so delicious~ First, it's blowing out the candles and making a wish.

昨天生日过得真开心啊！谢谢主人陪我！什么？冰箱里还有剩蛋糕？太可恶了！马上拿嘴巴去吃！#I had a really happy birthday yesterday! Thanks for the host for keeping me company! What? There's still cake left in the fridge? That's so annoying! I'll go eat it right away!:|
嗯。。生日蛋糕真好吃啊。。还想吃。。什么？今天也可以当生日过？！谢谢主人！#Mmm... The birthday cake is really delicious... I still want to eat... What? Today can also be celebrated as a birthday?! Thank you, master!:|
虽然生日已经过去了好几天，但是生日那天的气氛一直影响到现在呢。我才不是又想吃生日蛋糕了呢！哼！#Although my birthday has been over for a few days now, the atmosphere from that day still lingers on. It's not like I'm craving another birthday cake! Hmph!:|
过生日什么的太幼稚辣。人家也老大不小了，怎么可以去学小孩子过生日呢。和体重没关系！我被蛋糕所伤，今日起，戒蛋糕！#Celebrating birthdays and such is too childish. I'm not a child anymore, how can I follow the childish ways of celebrating birthdays? It has nothing to do with weight! I've been hurt by cakes, starting today, I'm giving up on cakes!:|
是突然发现一个哲学问题，只要我把每天都当生日，那我就可以每天都过生日了！这可是辩证唯物主义的大发现啊！#I suddenly realized a philosophical problem: if I treat every day as my birthday, then I can celebrate my birthday every day! This is a great discovery of dialectical materialism!:|
转眼之间已经过去一周了呢。生日的感觉也在慢慢淡忘。主人，明年你还愿意陪我一起过生日吗？#It's been a week since then. The feeling of my birthday is slowly fading away. Master, will you still be willing to celebrate my birthday with me next year?:|
